          Translation: an unnavigated life is not worth living. This is the
          motto of the Chornomortsi fraternity. We are a division of older
          scouts members of the Ukrainian scouting organization PLAST. Our name
          is Chornomortsi, or “Sailors of the Black Sea”. Our members all share
          an interest in maritime activities.

          For seventy years now we have been organizing our annual Morskiy Tabir
          sea scout camp. Every year, our counselors spend a week in the
          wilderness, teaching teenage campers the basics about sailing, water
          skiing, wake boarding , canoeing, kayaking, boating, swimming,
          lifeguarding and fishing. We also periodically run smaller weekend
          events for the scouts of PLAST, and a number of us are active
          scoutmasters in our respective cities.
