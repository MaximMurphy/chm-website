          Translation: an unnavigated life is not worth living. This is the
          motto of the Chornomortsi fraternity. We are a division of older
          scouts members of the Ukrainian scouting organization PLAST. Our name
          is Chornomortsi, or “Sailors of the Black Sea”. Our members all share
          an interest in maritime activities.

          For seventy years now we have been organizing our annual Morsky Tabir
          sea scout camp. Every year, our counselors spend a week in the
          wilderness, teaching teenage campers the basics about sailing, water
          skiing, wake boarding , canoeing, kayaking, boating, swimming,
          lifeguarding and fishing. We also periodically run smaller weekend
          events for the scouts of PLAST, and a number of us are active
          scoutmasters in our respective cities.

          Our emblem, which is worn by all full members of the fraternity, is
          rich with symbolic meaning about our origins. For example, the
          fraternity colors of black, white, and blue represent the waters of
          the Black Sea, our ship’s sails, and the sky above (respectively).

          The constellation Orion helps us navigate the seas, and the gold
          admiral’s anchor is a symbol of everlasting hope. In our ranks we have
          presidents of companies, engineers, artists, lawyers, doctors,
          university students, a nuclear physicist and even a rocket scientist.
